--forward-xdg-open=on|off|auto
       Intercept execution of xdg-open and forward the request  to  the
       client.

that's real interesting.

that suggests... some cool stuff.
* design
so:
- each connection opens a new emacsclient frame
  (necessary for multi-monitor)

but then how do we handle the lifecycle of emacs?
do we:
- autostart it on connection, like emacsclient -a -c?
- start it on boot and fail if there's no emacs running?
- just fail if there's no emacs running?

that third one is interesting actually.

then the user would be forced to maintain their own emacs lifecycle...

eh let's just autostart on connection, it's fine and by far the most convenient.

maybe we'll run it in a way where it exits if you have no frames left...
no that's tedious, emacs shouldn't exit if your connection drops.

how does it work in xpra?
do we have each frame in a separate x server and xpra server?

or are they in the same x server, just only one displayed per tab?

oh hm maybe we could just all connect to the same x server,
and you just switch frames with C-x 5 o,
or make new frames with C-x 5 2,
etc.

omg lmao we could use exwm...

hm.

if I really go fully into xpra,
then we can have the same set of frames in the browser and on the desktop.

that would be cool.

so if xpra just starts up Emacs,
and you can use it on your desktop too (or via ssh I guess lol),
then that's pretty nice.

and I guess closing Emacs would just close Emacs.

and then... I guess we just have xpra autorestart or something?

oh but how do you invoke emacs with --debug-init!!!

that sounds annoying!!

lmao what if...

oh I guess you could just spin up a second Emacs server or something...

oh!
we could have a prompt or something to decide which command to run?
* system-wide proxy server
so...

perhaps I install and enable this
(and then security will be less vexed)
* default-settings.txt

so I could set some things like "start" and "floating_menu=no" and "exit_with_children",
and thereby get an emacsclient per connection, kinda thing.
* emacs-centric
okay so what if this was started and managed by emacs, as an emacs package?

yes. perfect. a thing which just lets you connect to open a frame.

authentication is a bit tricky, but whatever.

so we just need to get rid of the header bars

aha! they're called window decorations internally,
and they go away when the window is fullscreened.

perfect!
** configure args
between
./configure -C --with-x-toolkit=no --without-cairo --without-xaw3d --without-gsettings --without-harfbuzz

and

./configure -C --with-x-toolkit=no --without-cairo --without-xaw3d --without-gsettings --without-harfbuzz --without-xft --without-lcms2 --without-xdbe

we started to work properly, ish

so that's good!

./configure -C --with-x-toolkit=no --without-cairo --without-xaw3d --without-gsettings --without-xdbe

also works fine

./configure -C --with-x-toolkit=no --without-cairo --without-gsettings --without-xdbe

also works fine

./configure -C --with-x-toolkit=no --without-cairo --without-gsettings

does not work!!!

./configure -C --with-x-toolkit=lucid --without-xdbe

works nicely...

damn. okay.

so it's double buffering that is the problem... curious......

https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12831115

(modify-frame-parameters nil '((inhibit-double-buffering . t)))
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnu-emacs/2022-11/msg01156.html

lol so xpra sucks

but! this is still achievable, we now know.
* gathered facts
- make it fullscreen
- set floating_menu=no in default-settings.txt
- set things like "start" and "exit_with_children" in default-settings.txt
- (modify-frame-parameters nil '((inhibit-double-buffering . t)))
  use \' to input the ', so 'asdfasd'\''asefasef'

okay so then how do we connect and get a new session?

hm. do we need a proxy server perhaps...

yeah probably?

so then we need to just make it so that...
every time you open one of these pages,
it starts a new xpra session and runs a command and exit with the client and children.

http://127.0.0.1:10000/?action=start&start=xterm&exit_with_client=yes&exit_with_children=yes

this makes the session and makes it exit when disconnecting, but doesn't actually connect

I may need to just make my own proxy server...

which may be easy enough, actually.
if I just use the Emacs webserver and redirect to a different port, rather than proxy...

that's pretty easy!

aha yes, --exit-with-client behaves correctly, it waits for the first client then exits.

right so we just need to write a tiny webserver which accepts a connection,
starts up an xpra server,
then redirects to that.

no proxying necessary.

ah and this will also allow...

- the url itself has the password, probably, cool
  which is securely communicated, nice, without necessarily using ssl
- the url can be copied to let someone else access the connection!
  cool!
  
we'll still use ssl though lol
* DONE resizing
okay yes when fullscreen we resize correctly

http://127.0.0.1:10000/?floating_menu=no
* resolution/dpi/whatever
hm!!

why is this...
not working right!!

http://127.0.0.1:10000/?floating_menu=no&override_width=2000

this works fine, but... why do I need this...

I guess it's a matter of the DPI?

no it's not

Chromium is reporting a weird screen size.

254x135 is 10 by 5.314, which the DPI is correct for.


document.getElementById('screen').clientHeight
509

HMm!!

weird.

oh claude is saying it might be css scaling
uhh lol idk

ohhhhhhhh no I just was zoomed in lol
* design
just have a command in Emacs which generates a URL

the URL will be for some public HTTPS client,
which will be given the password and destination to connect to.

I guess?

https://xpra.org/html5/connect.html

let's see!

and ah let's just prompt in Emacs to allow the connection.

(defun frameshare-prompt ()
  (if (yes-or-no-p "Allow connection?")
      nil
    (error "Connection denied")))

eh.
EH.

that's possible but not necessary.

hmm seems like we still get double-buffering for some reason...

xpra doesn't seem happy...

it definitely works if we start a new emacs and change its root params, hm...

* DONE double buffering turned off on the xpra side
CLOSED: [2025-02-20 Thu 10:35]
aha! perfect!

but, wait, is Emacs still trying to double-buffer for some reason? huh???

(x-double-buffered-p) is useful

I need to dig in more...

something is causing this bad rendering behavior...
oh and it might be actually a persistent problem with my own emacs,
since I can't seem to get it to stop any way...


whaaaaaaaaat

if the buffer is already displayed elsewhere...

we get repainting of the entire frame??? what???? why????

okay so that points to... some kind of contamination...

hmm...
very curious.

okay so the real issue is....

it seems to repaint the entirety of the other frame when we touch a different frame?!?!?

that's terrible!!

fdfsdf

this applies even when we disable double buffering... hm...

it's specifically only buffer modifications, which is odd...
minibuffer or echo area doesn't trigger it...

okay this probably doesn't matter TOO much...

but definitely a weird emacs bug...
* issues now
well it's annoying that I can't run it directly in my own shell buffer lol,
but whatever.

okay I got the command to have minimal errors:

XPRA_EXPORT_MENU_DATA=false /nix/store/ng20vsrvai62dsy87b41filsqs6j69z4-xpra-6.2.2/bin/xpra start --printing=no --webcam=no --mdns=no --pulseaudio=no --splash=no --daemon=no --exit-with-client --exit-with-children --terminate-children=yes --start-child='/home/sbaugh/xpra-cmd' --socket-dir=/home/sbaugh/.emacs.d/xpra --bind-tcp=127.0.0.1:10000 --html=/home/sbaugh/src/xpra-html5/html5 --http-scripts=all --source=/dev/null :100 -d compress

now... randomizing the port.

so... hmm...

I maybe don't need this because...

I can access different displays over the same port, by connecting to specific ones.

IF i have a proxy server, which I plausibly can.

the proxy server doesn't let me avoid the need for, um...
making a fresh xpra through a command each time.

but...

I can plausibly control it entirely through the proxy server, maybe?

oh hm wait...

will the proxy server let me skip authenticating, kinda thing?

I could have a per-user proxy server, perhaps...


--displayfd lets me get the display number which is nice...

but I don't actually have an easy way to grab that from emacs lol...

I can't... control the file descriptors... lol...

okay let's stick to port numbers

we'll just loop on accept process output,
with a timeout,
trying to read it from the log buffer.

ezpz.

then we can show a URL...

(man should I just be using xrdp or something lol)
** DONE elisp command
done!!!
sick
* exposing to the network at large
so...

it's a bit tricky...

if I run separate servers for each instance, then...

proxying with an ssl-enabled thing is tricky.

BUT, we can just have xpra provide its own ssl,
both in production (at JS) and locally on my box (with self-signed certs)

so let's just make some self-signed certs, ezpz.

openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout ~/.emacs.d/xpra-key.pem -out ~/.emacs.d/xpra-cert.pem -sha256 -days 3650 -nodes -subj "/C=US/CN=earth.catern.com"

maybe these will pop up every time and be annoying.
maybe this is a reason to use a consistent port...

okay yeah proxied up
* alternative URL design
fixed emacs0 emacs1 emacs2 through emacs9 urls

use socket activation to make them autostart the emacsclient when accessed
* use cases
- a frame you bookmark and use for normal work,
  and which should be usable for multiple displays,
  and all that
- sharing a frame (uses a long random URL)
- invoking a pop-up frame from the fe web UI or from other places,
  to show a specific feature
  
this last one means we want to be able to specify arguments to emacsclient,
and use a generated URL,
etc

but... we can defer all that, probably...

yeah okay so then we don't even really need this to be managed by emacs.
